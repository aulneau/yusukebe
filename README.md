Hi! I'm Yusuke Wada. My account name is "*yusukebe*" in almost any place. Please remember it. I'm a developer, creator, or supervisor. I don't want you to call me *full-stack*, but it seems to be *full-stack*.

> *I love "web"*.

I have grown up with the growth of "*web*". I've created many mush-up services, user-generated content systems, web API for mobile applications, manipulating big streaming data, useful CLI tools, and so on. Most are like junk, but a few have been used by some people.

I've contributed to "*web*" and will try to it.

> *Just for fun*.

This is my most favorite words.
I want to be a developer like a teenager who is a beginner of guitar, want to have own guitar, save money, get an new acoustic guitar,  playing it in a park on the mountain every time until his hands are broken.

## What I'm creating

You want to say, "*What are you creating now?*". Then I'll answer.

> *I'm making a framework everyday*.

You know, I'm a creator of [Hono](https://github.com/honojs/hono). And you can look up others on my GitHub repositories.
